There was no end to the\n applause, and when he came forward to bow his acknowledgments there were\n calls of \"Give another concert!\" The Krakowiak produced an immense effect,\n and was followed by four volleys of applause. His improvisation on the\n Polish national air \"W miescie dziwne obyczaje\" pleased only the people in\n the dress-circle, although he did not improvise in the way he had intended\n to do, which would not have been suitable for the audience that was\n present. From this and another remark, that few of the haute volee had as\n yet heard him, it appears that the aristocracy, for the most part living\n on their estates, was not largely represented at the concert. Thinking as\n he did of the public, he was surprised that the Adagio had found such\n general favour, and that he heard everywhere the most flattering remarks.\n He was also told that \"every note sounded like a bell,\" and that he had\n \"played much better on the second than on the first instrument.\" But\n although Elsner held that Chopin could only be judged after the second\n concert, and Kurpinski and others expressed their regret that he did not\n play on the Viennese instrument at the first one, he confesses that he\n would have preferred playing on his own piano. The success of the concerts\n may be measured by the following facts: A travelling virtuoso and former\n pupil of the Paris Conservatoire, Dunst by name, offered in his enthusiasm\n to treat Chopin with champagne; the day after the second concert a bouquet\n with a poem was sent to him; his fellow-student Orlowski wrote mazurkas\n and waltzes on the principal theme of the Concerto, and published them in\n spite of the horrified composer's request that he should not do so;\n Brzezina, the musicseller, asked him for his portrait, but, frightened at\n the prospect of seeing his counterfeit used as a wrapper for butter and\n cheese, Chopin ", "source_type": "literary", "dataset": "gutenberg", "generated_summary": "The concert was held at the Adagio in Vienna on the occasion of the first concert of the Prague Festival, and the audience was largely satisfied with the performance.", "topic": "History", "topic_confidence": 0.149, "emotion": "joy", "emotion_confidence": 0.5, "all_emotions": ["joy"]}

{"id": "book_Book_3894", "title": "Gutenberg #3894", "text": "The attempts of the Swiss geologists and archaeologists to estimate\n definitely in years the antiquity of the bronze and stone periods,\n although as yet confessedly imperfect, deserve notice, and appear to me to\n be full of promise. The most elaborate calculation is that made by M.\n Morlot, respecting the delta of the Tiniere, a torrent which flows into\n the Lake of Geneva near Villeneuve. This small delta, to which the stream\n is annually making additions, is composed of gravel and sand. Its shape is\n that of a flattened cone, and its internal structure has of late been laid\n open to view in a railway cutting 1000 feet long and 32 feet deep. The\n regularity of its structure throughout implies that it has been formed\n very gradually, and by the uniform action of the same causes. Three layers\n of vegetable soil, each of which must at one time have formed the surface\n of the cone, have been cut through at different depths. The first of these\n was traced over a surface of 15,000 square feet, having an average\n thickness of 5 inches, and being about 4 feet below the present surface of\n the cone. This upper layer belonged to the Roman period, and contained\n Roman tiles and a coin. The second layer, followed over a surface of\n 25,000 square feet, was 6 inches thick, and lay at a depth of 10 feet. In\n it were found fragments of unvarnished pottery and a pair of tweezers in\n bronze, indicating the bronze epoch.

Indeed, his quartet writing is often bald\n and uninteresting. But at least he did write in four-part harmony, and it\n is certainly to him that we owe the installation of the quartet as a\n distinct species of chamber music. \"It is not often,\" says Otto Jahn, the\n biographer of Mozart, \"that a composer hits so exactly upon the form\n suited to his conceptions; the quartet was Haydn's natural mode of\n expressing his feelings.\" This is placing the Haydn quartet in a very high\n position among the products of its creator. But its artistic value and\n importance cannot well be over-estimated. Even Mozart, who set a noble\n seal upon the form, admitted that it was from Haydn he had first learned\n the true way to compose quartets; and there have been enthusiasts who\n regarded the Haydn quartet with even more veneration than the Haydn\n symphony. No fewer than seventy-seven quartets are ascribed to him.\n Needless to say, they differ considerably as regards their style and\n treatment, for the first was written so early as 1755, while the last\n belongs to his later years. But they are all characterized by the same\n combination of manly earnestness, rich invention and mirthful spirit. The\n form is concise and symmetrical, the part-writing is clear and\n well-balanced, and a \"sunny sweetness\" is the prevailing mood. As a\n discerning critic has remarked, there is nothing in the shape of\n instrumental music much pleasanter and easier to listen to than one of\n Haydn's quartets.

Putting aside past experience, they should learn whether their soils are now acid. Practical farmers may judge by the character of the vegetation and not fail to be right nine times out of ten. Where land has drainage, and a fairly good amount of available fertility, as evidenced by growths of grass, a failure of red clover leads immediately to a strong suspicion that lime is lacking. If alsike clover grows more readily than the red clover, the probability of acidity grows stronger because the alsike can thrive under more acid soil conditions than can the red. Acid soils favor red-top grass rather than timothy. Sorrel is a weed that thrives in both alkaline and acid soils, and its presence would not be an index if it could stand competition with clover in an alkaline soil. The clover can crowd it out if the ground is not too badly infested with seed, and even then the sorrel must finally give way. Where sorrel and plantain cover the ground that has been seeded to clover and grass, the evidence is strong that the soil conditions are unfriendly to the better plants on account of a lime deficiency.
