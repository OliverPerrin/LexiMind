{"id": "book_Book_2001", "title": "Gutenberg #2001", "text": "Let us, provisionally, accept the theory of a partial deluge, and try to\n form a clear mental picture of the occurrence. Let us suppose that, for\n forty days and forty nights, such a vast quantity of water was poured upon\n the ground that the whole surface of Mesopotamia was covered by water to a\n depth certainly greater, probably much greater, than fifteen cubits, or\n twenty feet (Gen. vii. 20). The inundation prevails upon the earth for one\n hundred and fifty days and then the flood gradually decreases, until, on\n the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark, which had previously\n floated on its surface, grounds upon the \"mountains of Ararat\" 10\n (Gen. viii. 34). Then, as Diestel has acutely pointed out (\"Sintflut,\" p.\n 13), we are to imagine the further subsidence of the flood to take place\n so gradually that it was not until nearly two months and a half after this\n time (that is to say, on the first day of the tenth month) that the \"tops\n of the mountains\" became visible. Hence it follows that, if the ark drew\n even as much as twenty feet of water, the level of the inundation fell\n very slowly\u2014at a rate of only a few inches a day\u2014until the top\n of the mountain on which it rested became visible.

These being the conditions of the\n case, the following inquiry naturally presents itself: not, be it\n observed, as a recondite problem, generated by modern speculation, but as\n a plain suggestion flowing out of that very ordinary and archaic piece of\n knowledge that water cannot be piled up like in a heap, like sand; or that\n it seeks the lowest level.

Mother, once I was reported \"missing, killed or believed taken prisoner.\" I went with a patrol to a certain place beyond which we went forward to a place which had recently been taken by the English infantry. Suddenly the enemy's fire fell upon us and behind us like water. Seeing we could not go back, we lay down in the holes made by the shells. The enemy exerted himself to the utmost, but our guns having found him bombarded him and he ceased. In the evening we retired out of our shell-holes. We had to walk; it was fasting time and we suffered from thirst. So our hearts were relieved when we returned to the Regiment. We had all been reported to Divisional Headquarters as lost. This false report was then cancelled. The shell-holes in the ground are the size of our goat-pen and as deep as my height with the arm raised.
