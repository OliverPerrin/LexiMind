There was no end to the\n applause, and when he came forward to bow his acknowledgments there were\n calls of \"Give another concert!\" The Krakowiak produced an immense effect,\n and was followed by four volleys of applause. His improvisation on the\n Polish national air \"W miescie dziwne obyczaje\" pleased only the people in\n the dress-circle, although he did not improvise in the way he had intended\n to do, which would not have been suitable for the audience that was\n present. From this and another remark, that few of the haute volee had as\n yet heard him, it appears that the aristocracy, for the most part living\n on their estates, was not largely represented at the concert. Thinking as\n he did of the public, he was surprised that the Adagio had found such\n general favour, and that he heard everywhere the most flattering remarks.\n He was also told that \"every note sounded like a bell,\" and that he had\n \"played much better on the second than on the first instrument.\" But\n although Elsner held that Chopin could only be judged after the second\n concert, and Kurpinski and others expressed their regret that he did not\n play on the Viennese instrument at the first one, he confesses that he\n would have preferred playing on his own piano. The success of the concerts\n may be measured by the following facts: A travelling virtuoso and former\n pupil of the Paris Conservatoire, Dunst by name, offered in his enthusiasm\n to treat Chopin with champagne; the day after the second concert a bouquet\n with a poem was sent to him; his fellow-student Orlowski wrote mazurkas\n and waltzes on the principal theme of the Concerto, and published them in\n spite of the horrified composer's request that he should not do so;\n Brzezina, the musicseller, asked him for his portrait, but, frightened at\n the prospect of seeing his counterfeit used as a wrapper for butter and\n cheese, Chopin ", "source_type": "literary", "dataset": "gutenberg", "generated_summary": "The symphony of the Orchestra, which was a part of the Concerto, was accompanied by a chorus of musicians, and the orchestra was surrounded by saxophones.

The most elaborate calculation is that made by M.\n Morlot, respecting the delta of the Tiniere, a torrent which flows into\n the Lake of Geneva near Villeneuve. This small delta, to which the stream\n is annually making additions, is composed of gravel and sand. Its shape is\n that of a flattened cone, and its internal structure has of late been laid\n open to view in a railway cutting 1000 feet long and 32 feet deep. The\n regularity of its structure throughout implies that it has been formed\n very gradually, and by the uniform action of the same causes. Three layers\n of vegetable soil, each of which must at one time have formed the surface\n of the cone, have been cut through at different depths. The first of these\n was traced over a surface of 15,000 square feet, having an average\n thickness of 5 inches, and being about 4 feet below the present surface of\n the cone. This upper layer belonged to the Roman period, and contained\n Roman tiles and a coin. The second layer, followed over a surface of\n 25,000 square feet, was 6 inches thick, and lay at a depth of 10 feet. In\n it were found fragments of unvarnished pottery and a pair of tweezers in\n bronze, indicating the bronze epoch. The third layer, followed for 35,000\n square feet, was 6 or 7 inches thick and 19 feet deep. In it were\n fragments of rude pottery, pieces of charcoal, broken bones, and a human\n skeleton having a small, round and very thick skull. M. Morlot, assuming\n the Roman period to represent an antiquity of from sixteen to eighteen\n centuries, assigns to the bronze age a date of between 3000 and 4000\n years, and to the oldest layer, that of the stone period, an age of from\n 5000 to 7000 years.", "source_type": "literary", "dataset": "gutenberg", "generated_summary": "In the present passage, we are able to see the surface of the cone, which is a large cone, with a diameter of about.

When the forefeet are reached, cut the skin away from them at the wrists, and then skin over the head until the mouth is reached when the skin should be finally removed at the lips.\nOne thing to be borne in mind when stretching a skin to dry, is that it must be drawn tight; another, that it must be stretched in a place where neither the heat of a fire or that of the sun will reach it too strongly, and it should not be washed.

Indeed, his quartet writing is often bald\n and uninteresting. But at least he did write in four-part harmony, and it\n is certainly to him that we owe the installation of the quartet as a\n distinct species of chamber music. \"It is not often,\" says Otto Jahn, the\n biographer of Mozart, \"that a composer hits so exactly upon the form\n suited to his conceptions; the quartet was Haydn's natural mode of\n expressing his feelings.\" This is placing the Haydn quartet in a very high\n position among the products of its creator.

No fewer than seventy-seven quartets are ascribed to him.\n Needless to say, they differ considerably as regards their style and\n treatment, for the first was written so early as 1755, while the last\n belongs to his later years. But they are all characterized by the same\n combination of manly earnestness, rich invention and mirthful spirit. The\n form is concise and symmetrical, the part-writing is clear and\n well-balanced, and a \"sunny sweetness\" is the prevailing mood. As a\n discerning critic has remarked, there is nothing in the shape of\n instrumental music much pleasanter and easier to listen to than one of\n Haydn's quartets. The best of them hold their places in the concert-rooms\n of to-day, and they seem likely to live as long as there are people to\n appreciate clear and logical composition which attempts nothing beyond\n \"organized simplicity.\" [See W.

Putting aside past experience, they should learn whether their soils are now acid. Practical farmers may judge by the character of the vegetation and not fail to be right nine times out of ten. Where land has drainage, and a fairly good amount of available fertility, as evidenced by growths of grass, a failure of red clover leads immediately to a strong suspicion that lime is lacking. If alsike clover grows more readily than the red clover, the probability of acidity grows stronger because the alsike can thrive under more acid soil conditions than can the red. Acid soils favor red-top grass rather than timothy. Sorrel is a weed that thrives in both alkaline and acid soils, and its presence would not be an index if it could stand competition with clover in an alkaline soil. The clover can crowd it out if the ground is not too badly infested with seed, and even then the sorrel must finally give way. Where sorrel and plantain cover the ground that has been seeded to clover and grass, the evidence is strong that the soil conditions are unfriendly to the better plants on account of a lime deficiency.

With what experiences of march and battle were\n those four years filled! For three of these years Gulnare had been my\n constant companion.

Anon she would rise to her feet and\n shake herself, walk off a few rods, return and lie down again by my side.\n I did not know what to make of it, unless the excitement of the day had\n been too much for her sensitive nerves. I spoke to her kindly and petted\n her. In response she would rub her nose against me, and lick my hand with\n her tongue\u2014a peculiar habit of hers\u2014like a dog.

His philosophy is based on the child-like assumption\n that things are as they seem, provided they are observed with sufficient\n care by a sufficient number of people. This brings us at once to the very\n heart of Holbach's method which was experimental and inductive to the last\n degree. Holbach was nourished on what might be called scientific rather\n than philosophical traditions. As M. Tourneux has pointed out, he had been\n a serious student of the natural sciences, especially those connected with\n the constitution of the earth. These studies led him to see the disparity\n between certain accepted and traditional cosmologies and a scientific\n interpretation of the terrestrial globe and the forms of life which\n flourish upon it. Finding the supposed sacred and infallible records\n untrustworthy in one regard, he began to question their veracity at other\n points. Being of a critical frame of mind, he took the records rather more\n literally than a sympathetic, allegorical apologist would have done,\n although it cannot be said that he used much historical insight. After\n having studied the sacred texts for purposes of writing or having\n translated other men's studies on Moses, David, the Prophets, Jesus, Paul,\n the Christian theologians and saints, miracles, etc., he concluded that\n these accounts were untrustworthy and mendacious. He knew ancient and\n modern philosophy and found in the greater part of it an unwarranted\n romantic or theological trend which his scientific training had caused him\n to suspect. It must be admitted that however false or illogical Holbach's\n conclusions may be considered, he was by no means ignorant of the subjects\n he chose to treat, as some of his detractors would have one believe. His\n theory of knowledge was that of Locke and Condillac, and on this\n foundation he built up his system of scientific naturalism and dogmatic\n atheism.", "source_type": "literary", "dataset": "gutenberg", "generated_summary": "In the study of the universe, the cosmology is a matter of great importance, and in this way, the Bible is regarded as a sacred object.

That was why large and enthusiastic\n concourses of people in the streets produced so little effect upon the\n English Government\" The great Nizzard insurgent had been mystified by the\n impotence of popular enthusiasm.

The maximum lift-drag ratio of 20.4 is attained at a negative angle -08\u00b0. The value of Ky at this point is 0.00086, an extremely low figure. The maximum Ky is 0.00288 at 14.0\u00b0, the L/D ratio being 4.0 at this angle. Structurally it is the worst wing that we have yet discussed, being almost \"paper thin\" for a considerable distance near the trailing edge. The under surface is deeply cambered, with the maximum under camber about one-third from the trailing edge. It is impossible to use this wing without a very long overhang in the rear of the section, and like the Eiffel 32, the front spar must be very far forward. For those desiring flexible trailing edges, this is an ideal section. This wing is best adapted for speed scouts and racing machines because of its great L/D, but as its lift is small and the center of pressure movement rapid at the point of maximum lift-drag, it would be necessary to fly at a small range of angles and land at an extremely high speed. Any slight change in the angle of incidence causes the lift-drag ratio to drop at a rapid rate, and hence the wing could only be manipulated at its most efficient angle by an experienced pilot. Again, the angle of maximum L/D is only a few degrees from the angle of no lift.\nU.S.A. Wing Sections. These wing sections were developed by the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps, United States Army, and are decided improvements on any wing sections yet published.

The best perennial hardy plant I know for this purpose is the gas plant (Dictamnus fraxinella), which, when once established, remains a joy, almost forever. Some people are still enjoying the blooms of plants set out by their great-grandmothers. This plant is slow in increasing its size, but a row planted twelve inches apart will in time make a compact hedge with a dark green, lustrous foliage, over two feet tall and fully as broad. The flower spikes are borne well above the foliage, some pink, deeply veined a darker hue, and some white. A mixture of the colors is desirable. On account of the slow habit of its increase, the bed will look scantily furnished for a few years.
