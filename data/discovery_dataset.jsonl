Disproving the popular thought that primitive life was simple, this monumental survey shows that savage man was enmeshed in a tangle of magic, taboos, and superstitions. Revealed here is the evolution of man from savagery to civilization, from the modification of his weird and often bloodthirsty customs to the entry of lasting moral, ethical, and spiritual values."}

The key innovation is the scaled dot-product attention, which computes attention weights as softmax(QK^T/sqrt(d_k))V, where Q, K, and V are query, key, and value matrices respectively. Multi-head attention extends this by projecting inputs into multiple subspaces, allowing the model to attend to different types of relationships simultaneously. This parallelizable architecture enabled training on much larger datasets and led to breakthrough models like BERT, GPT, and T5.

Generally speaking, the Algonquins which included the Powhatan Confederacy inhabited the Tidewater, reaching from the Potomac to the James River and extending to the Eastern Shore. The Siouan tribes, including the Monacans and the Manahoacs, occupied the Piedmont; while the Iroquoian group, containing the independent Nottoways and Meherrins, partially surrounded the others in a rough semicircle reaching from the headwaters of the Chesapeake through the western mountains and back to the coast in the region south of the James River.\n\nThe presence of these tribes in the areas of proposed colonization confronted the colonizers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with the same problem that has faced imperialists of a later date, the question of \"right and title\" to land. The British, like other European nations, did not recognize the sovereign right of the heathen natives but claimed a general title to the area by the prevailing doctrine of right by discovery and later by the generally accepted doctrine of effective occupation.

This is a nearer approximation than he\r\n      has yet made to a complete definition, and, regarded as a piece of\r\n      proverbial or popular morality, is not far from the truth. But the\r\n      objection is urged, 'that the honourable is the good,' and as every one\r\n      equally desires the good, the point of the definition is contained in the\r\n      words, 'the power of getting them.' 'And they must be got justly or with\r\n      justice.' The definition will then stand thus: 'Virtue is the power of\r\n      getting good with justice.'

{"id": "literary_475", "title": "The Poetics Of Aristotle", "text": "Since the objects of imitation are men in action, and these men must be\r\n      either of a higher or a lower type (for moral character mainly answers to\r\n      these divisions, goodness and badness being the distinguishing marks of\r\n      moral differences), it follows that we must represent men either as better\r\n      than in real life, or as worse, or as they are. It is the same in\r\n      painting. Polygnotus depicted men as nobler than they are, Pauson as less\r\n      noble, Dionysius drew them true to life.\n\nNow it is evident that each of the modes of imitation above mentioned will\r\n      exhibit these differences, and become a distinct kind in imitating objects\r\n      that are thus distinct. Such diversities may be found even in dancing,\r\n      flute-playing, and lyre-playing. So again in language, whether prose or\r\n      verse unaccompanied by music. Homer, for example, makes men better than\r\n      they are; Cleophon as they are; Hegemon the Thasian, the inventor of\r\n      parodies, and Nicochares, the author of the Deiliad, worse than they are.\r\n      The same thing holds good of Dithyrambs and Nomes; here too one may\r\n      portray different types, as Timotheus and Philoxenus differed in\r\n      representing their Cyclopes. The same distinction marks off Tragedy from\r\n      Comedy; for Comedy aims at representing men as worse, Tragedy as better\r\n      than in actual life.\n\nThese, then, as we said at the beginning, are the three differences which\r\n      distinguish artistic imitation,\u2014the medium, the objects, and the\r\n      manner. So that from one point of view, Sophocles is an imitator of the\r\n      same kind as Homer\u2014for both imitate higher types of character; from\r\n      another point of view, of the same kind as Aristophanes\u2014for both\r\n      imitate persons acting and doing. Hence, some say, the name of 'drama' is\r\n      given to such poems, as representing action. For the same reason the\r\n      Dorians claim the invention both of Tragedy and Comedy.

{"id": "literary_369", "title": "The Alchemist: A Graphic Novel", "text": "Ben Jonson came of the stock that was centuries after to give to the world\r\n      Thomas Carlyle; for Jonson's grandfather was of Annandale, over the\r\n      Solway, whence he migrated to England. Jonson's father lost his estate\r\n      under Queen Mary, \"having been cast into prison and forfeited.\" He entered\r\n      the church, but died a month before his illustrious son was born, leaving\r\n      his widow and child in poverty. Jonson's birthplace was Westminster, and\r\n      the time of his birth early in 1573. He was thus nearly ten years\r\n      Shakespeare's junior, and less well off, if a trifle better born. But\r\n      Jonson did not profit even by this slight advantage. His mother married\r\n      beneath her, a wright or bricklayer, and Jonson was for a time apprenticed\r\n      to the trade. As a youth he attracted the attention of the famous\r\n      antiquary, William Camden, then usher at Westminster School, and there the\r\n      poet laid the solid foundations of his classical learning. Jonson always\r\n      held Camden in veneration, acknowledging that to him he owed,\n\nIn 1592, Jonson returned from abroad penniless. Soon after he married,\r\n      almost as early and quite as imprudently as Shakespeare. He told Drummond\r\n      curtly that \"his wife was a shrew, yet honest\"; for some years he lived\r\n      apart from her in the household of Lord Albany. Yet two touching epitaphs\r\n      among Jonson's \"Epigrams,\" \"On my first daughter,\" and \"On my first son,\"\r\n      attest the warmth of the poet's family affections. The daughter died in\r\n      infancy, the son of the plague; another son grew up to manhood little\r\n      credit to his father whom he survived. We know nothing beyond this of\r\n      Jonson's domestic life.\n\nReturning to the autumn of 1598, an event now happened to sever for a time\r\n      Jonson's relations with Henslowe. In a letter to Alleyn, dated September\r\n      26 of that year, Henslowe writes: \"I have lost one of my company that\r\n      hurteth me great", "source_type": "literary", "dataset": "gutenberg", "topic": "Fiction", "topic_confidence": 0.8, "emotion": "neutral", "emotion_confidence": 0.0, "generated_summary": "", "reference_summary": "Andalusian shepherd boy Santiago travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids.
