The first is the search after the Sophist, the second is the\r\n      enquiry into the nature of Not-being, which occupies the middle part of\r\n      the work. For 'Not-being' is the hole or division of the dialectical net\r\n      in which the Sophist has hidden himself. He is the imaginary impersonation\r\n      of false opinion. Yet he denies the possibility of false opinion; for\r\n      falsehood is that which is not, and therefore has no existence. At length\r\n      the difficulty is solved; the answer, in the language of the Republic,\r\n      appears 'tumbling out at our feet.' Acknowledging that there is a\r\n      communion of kinds with kinds, and not merely one Being or Good having\r\n      different names, or several isolated ideas or classes incapable of\r\n      communion, we discover 'Not-being' to be the other of 'Being.'\r\n      Transferring this to language and thought, we have no difficulty in\r\n      apprehending that a proposition may be false as well as true. The Sophist,\r\n      drawn out of the shelter which Cynic and Megarian paradoxes have\r\n      temporarily afforded him, is proved to be a dissembler and juggler with\r\n      words.\n\nThe chief points of interest in the dialogue are: (I) the character\r\n      attributed to the Sophist: (II) the dialectical method: (III) the nature\r\n      of the puzzle about 'Not-being:' (IV) the battle of the philosophers: (V)\r\n      the relation of the Sophist to other dialogues.\n\nMany words are used both in a general and a specific sense, and the two\r\n      senses are not always clearly distinguished.

{"id": "literary_220", "title": "Church History: A Crash Course for the Curious", "text": "The English reader is here presented with a translation of the ninth edition of a work which first appeared in\u00a01849, and has obtained a most distinguished place, it might be said almost a monopoly, as a text-book of Church History in the German Universities. Since 1850, when the second edition was issued, an English translation of which has been widely used in Britain and America, Dr.\u00a0Kurtz has given great attention to the improvement of his book. The increase of size has not been caused by wordy amplification, but by an urgent necessity felt by the author as he used the vast materials that recent years have spread out before the historical student. In\u00a01870 Dr.\u00a0Kurtz retired from his professorship, and has conscientiously devoted himself to bring up each successive edition of his text-book to the point reached by the very latest scholarship of his own and other lands. In his Preface to the ninth edition of 1885 he claims to have made very special improvements on the presentation of the history of the first three centuries, where ample use is made of the brilliant researches of Harnack and other distinguished scholars of the day.\n\nThe first English volume is a reproduction without retrenchment of the original; but in the second volume an endeavour has been made to render the text-book more convenient and serviceable to British and American students by slightly abridging some of those paragraphs which give minute details of the Reformation work in various German provinces. But even there care has been taken not to omit any fact of interest or importance. No pains have been spared to give the English edition a form that may entitle it to occupy that front rank among students\u2019 text-books of Church History which the original undoubtedly holds in Germany.\n\nWhile the translator was working from the ninth edition of\u00a01885, a tenth edition had appeared during\u00a01887, to which unfortunately his attention was not called until quite recently.

{"id": "literary_243", "title": "Politics (Big Easy Bears Book 0)", "text": "In an early dialogue of Plato's, the Protagoras, Socrates asks Protagoras\r\n      why it is not as easy to find teachers of virtue as it is to find teachers\r\n      of swordsmanship, riding, or any other art. Protagoras' answer is that\r\n      there are no special teachers of virtue, because virtue is taught by the\r\n      whole community. Plato and Aristotle both accept the view of moral\r\n      education implied in this answer. In a passage of the Republic (492 b)\r\n      Plato repudiates the notion that the sophists have a corrupting moral\r\n      influence upon young men. The public themselves, he says, are the real\r\n      sophists and the most complete and thorough educators. No private\r\n      education can hold out against the irresistible force of public opinion\r\n      and the ordinary moral standards of society. But that makes it all the\r\n      more essential that public opinion and social environment should not be\r\n      left to grow up at haphazard as they ordinarily do, but should be made by\r\n      the wise legislator the expression of the good and be informed in all\r\n      their details by his knowledge. The legislator is the only possible\r\n      teacher of virtue.\n\nThis combination of idealism and respect for the teachings of experience\r\n      constitutes in some ways the strength and value of the Politics, but it\r\n      also makes it harder to follow. The large nation states to which we are\r\n      accustomed make it difficult for us to think that the state could be\r\n      constructed and modelled to express the good life. We can appreciate\r\n      Aristotle's critical analysis of constitutions, but find it hard to take\r\n      seriously his advice to the legislator. Moreover, the idealism and the\r\n      empiricism of the Politics are never really reconciled by Aristotle\r\n      himself.\n\nAristotle's Politics, then, is a handbook for the legislator, the expert\r\n      who is to be called in when a state wants help.

Even the roar of the elevated trains on Sixth Avenue and the screech of their wheels as the cars turned the corner of the filthy street in the rear were music. A secret joy filled the world. Nothing could break its spell\u2014not even the devilish incessant rattle of the machine hammers flattening the heads of the rivets on the huge steel warehouse of the American Chemical Company rising across the avenue. The music he heard was from within, and the glory of life was shining from his eyes.\n\nThe dreamer closed his eyes and smiled.

How well he remembered every detail of that ramble over the red hills\u2014he could hear now the whistle of a bob white sitting on the fence near the spring where they lunched, calling to his mate. As Nan nestled closer on the old stile, they saw the little brown bird slip from her nest in a clump of straw, lift her head, and softly answer.\n\nHe recalled distinctly his tremor of sympathetic excitement as her warm hand drew him to the spot. With peculiar vividness he remembered the extraordinary moisture of the palm of her hand trembling with eager interest as he counted the eggs\u2014twenty beauties. But above all memories stood out one! As he bent close above her he caught for the first time in his life the delicate perfume of her dark rich hair and felt the thrill of its mystery.\n\nAnd when she stood silent and blushing, he made the final plunge.
