Yet I can find nothing else by which to\n guide my opinion. I must follow these tracks in my search after truth, for\n I have none more trustworthy than these; I will take pains to weigh the\n value of these with all possible care, and will not hastily give my assent\n to them. For instance, in a battle, it may happen that my hand may be\n deceived by some mistake into turning my weapon against my comrade, and\n sparing my enemy as though he were on my side; but this will not often\n take place, and will not take place through any fault of mine, for my\n object is to strike the enemy, and defend my countryman. If I know a man\n to be ungrateful, I shall not bestow a benefit upon him. But the man has\n passed himself off as a good man by some trick, and has imposed upon me.\n Well, this is not at all the fault of the giver, who gave under the\n impression that his friend was grateful. \"Suppose,\" asks he, \"that you\n were to promise to bestow a benefit, and afterwards were to learn that\n your man was ungrateful, would you bestow it or not?

This case upsets your consistency, and that proud assurance of yours\n that the wise man never regrets his actions, or amends what he has done,\n or alters his plans.\" The wise man never changes his plans while the\n conditions under which he formed them remain the same; therefore, he never\n feels regret, because at the time nothing better than what he did could\n have been done, nor could any better decision have been arrived at than\n that which was made; yet he begins everything with the saving clause, \"If\n nothing shall occ", "source_type": "literary", "dataset": "gutenberg", "generated_summary": "The symphony is a spherical sex opera, and the saxophone is snazzy.

The idea of an \"Atheist\" as one\n warring against moral restraints\u2014of an \"Infidel\" as one treacherous\n to the truth\u2014of a \"Freethinker\" as a \"loose thinker,\"* arose in the\n darkness of past times, when men fought by the flickering light of their\n hatreds\u2014times which tradition has peopled with monsters of divinity\n as well as of nature.

It is true, when the teacher craftily told him stories of the prices that some lucky artists received for their work, he felt as though she were pointing down into a gold mine. But the money in his hand was good money, and he never sent good money after bad. And so Henrietta's newly raised hope of being an artist was dashed, and Rob Riley was grievously disappointed; for he was sure that Henrietta would astonish the metropolis if once she could take her transcendent ability out of East Weston into New York. Besides, Rob Riley himself was going off to New York to develop his own talent by learning the granite cutter's trade. He confided to Henrietta that he expected to come to something better than granite cutting, for he had heard that there had been granite cutters who, being, like himself, good at figures, in time had come to be great contractors and builders and bosses. He was going to be something, and when he was settled at work in New York Henrietta had a letter from him telling that he was learning mechanical drawing in the Cooper Union night school, and that he got books out of the Apprentices' Library. He also attended free lectures, and was looking out for a chance to be something some day.

Gregory declared, at his accession, that he would resign if Benedict at Avignon would do the same. An attempt was made to get rid of both of them, so that they could agree upon a third. The Council of Pisa deposed both, and elected Alexander V. Benedict refused to vacate his chair; and Gregory retained his position because his rival refused to compromise. Instead of getting rid of one, the church had now three popes who claimed the chair. Alexander died in 1410; and his successor, John XXIII., called the Council of Constance. It was not a meeting of bishops merely, but was attended by cardinals, archbishops, ambassadors of kings, knights, and delegates from universities. John presided at the first session, and was invited to resign the pontifical office. He promised to do so if Gregory and Benedict would do the same; but the next night he fled secretly to Schaffhausen, and from thence to Freiburg. After much trouble, negotiations were opened with him, and he resigned his office. He was afterwards thrown into prison with Huss.

The total length of the fuselage depends upon the type of power plant, upon the span or chord of the wings, and upon the arrangement of the tail surfaces. The rear end of the fuselage should be far enough away from the wings to insure that the rear surfaces are not unduly affected by the \"down-wash\" or the \"wake-stream\" of the wings. A very short fuselage gives a short lever arm to the control surfaces, hence these surfaces must be very large with a short body. With the stabilizer surface close to the wings, the \"damping\" effect is slight, that is, the surface does not effectively kill or \"damp down\" oscillations. Large tail surfaces are heavy, difficult to brace, and cause a very considerable amount of head resistance. The extra weight of a long fuselage is generally offset by the increased weight caused by the large tail area of the short body type.\nWhen machines are crated and shipped at frequent intervals, a very long fuselage is objectionable unless it is built in two sections. It also requires much storage space and a very long hangar. Machines for private use must often be sacrificed from the efficiency standpoint in order to keep the dimensions within reasonable limits. An aeroplane requiring an enormous hangar has certainly no attraction for the average man. Every effort must be made to condense the overall dimensions or to arrange the extremities so that they can be easily dismounted. Exhibition flyers require specially portable machines since they ship them nearly every day, and the expense of handling a long awkward fuselage may alone determine the choice of a plane. It is usually best to divide the body at a point just to the rear of the pilot's seat, although many flyers look upon a two-part body with disfavor unless they can be shown that the joint connections are as strong as the rest of the fuselage.", "source_type": "literary", "dataset": "gutenberg", "generated_summary": "And.", "topic": "Arts", "topic_confidence": 0.631, "emotion": "neutral", "emotion_confidence": 0.445, "all_emotions": ["neutral", "admiration", "approval"]}

Where land has drainage, and a fairly good amount of available fertility, as evidenced by growths of grass, a failure of red clover leads immediately to a strong suspicion that lime is lacking. If alsike clover grows more readily than the red clover, the probability of acidity grows stronger because the alsike can thrive under more acid soil conditions than can the red. Acid soils favor red-top grass rather than timothy. Sorrel is a weed that thrives in both alkaline and acid soils, and its presence would not be an index if it could stand competition with clover in an alkaline soil. The clover can crowd it out if the ground is not too badly infested with seed, and even then the sorrel must finally give way. Where sorrel and plantain cover the ground that has been seeded to clover and grass, the evidence is strong that the soil conditions are unfriendly to the better plants on account of a lime deficiency. The experienced farmer who notes the inclination of his soil to favor alsike clover, red-top, sorrel, and plantain should infer that lime is lacking.

One is T'ien, which has come to\n include the material heavens, the sky; and the other is Shang Ti,\n which has come to include the spirits of deceased Emperors. These two\n terms appear simultaneously, so to speak, in the earliest documents which\n have come down to us, dating back to something like the twentieth century\n before Christ. Priority, however, belongs beyond all doubt to T'ien,\n which it would have been more natural to find meaning, first the visible\n heavens, and secondly the Deity, whose existence beyond the sky would be\n inferred from such phenomena as lightning, thunder, wind, and rain. But\n the process appears to have been the other way, so far at any rate as the\n written language is concerned. The Chinese script, when it first came into\n existence, was purely pictorial, and confined to visible objects which\n were comparatively easy to depict. There does not seem to have been any\n attempt to draw a picture of the sky. On the other hand, the character T'ien\n was just such a representation of a human being as would be expected from\n the hand of a prehistoric artist; and under this unmistakable shape the\n character appears on bells and tripods, as seen in collections of\n inscriptions, so late as the sixth and seventh centuries B.C., after which\n the head is flattered to a line, and the arms are raised until they form\n another line parallel to that of the head.", "source_type": "literary", "dataset": "gutenberg", "generated_summary": "The inscriptions on the tomb are a reminder of the importance of the inscription.", "topic": "Fiction", "topic_confidence": 0.592, "emotion": "neutral", "emotion_confidence": 0.513, "all_emotions": ["neutral", "disapproval", "love"]}
